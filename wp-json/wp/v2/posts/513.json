Clean and disinfect regularly. The flu can spread when people touch infected surfaces and then touch their eyes, mouth, or nose. However, flu viruse\u2026s are fairly easy to kill when using appropriate products as part of the cleaning and disinfecting process, but this must be done regularly, especially during flu season. Remember to always remove visible soil from surfaces, followed by targeted disinfecting.<br \/>\n2. Target high-touch surfaces. Objects and surfaces that are frequently touched such as desks, countertops, doorknobs, keyboards, faucets, and phones need to be disinfected at least once a day with a disinfectant. Specific germ-prone areas such as bathrooms should also be given more attention.<br \/>\n3. Choose the right products. Influenza viruses can survive on both hard and soft surfaces for hours, providing ample opportunity for cross-contamination and the spread of infection, so it is important to use products that are registered to kill influenza and are effective on hard and soft surfaces. Several types of disinfectants are effective against the flu including chlorine bleach, hydrogen peroxide, and quaternary ammonium-based cleaners. No matter which product you use, it is important to always read the product label to ensure that it is registered to kill the Influenza A virus.<br \/>\n4. Use products correctly. Remember, the best results are achieved when disinfectants are used correctly. It is important to always refer to the product label and follow the manufacturer\u2019s instructions for use and contact time, or the length of time the disinfectant needs to remain wet on the surface to properly kill pathogens. Different products have different contact times for killing certain pathogens.<br \/>\n5. Educate cleaning staff and other employees about personal flu prevention steps. The Centre for Disease Control recommends that businesses encourage employees to get a seasonal flu vaccine and discourage sick employees from coming to work. In addition, instruct employees to wash their hands regularly with soap and water, especially after emptying waste baskets, touching used tissues, or using the restroom.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We may be nearing the end of February, but it doesn\u2019t look like winter is going to go away any time soon.\u00a0 Follow these 5 simple tips to prevent the spread of the flu virus (or any of those other nasty germs lurking around): 1.
